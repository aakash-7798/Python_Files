Estimate Sales
A famous bookseller named Book Hop is conquering the bookselling industry with a huge presence of thirty stalls across the world. They achieved good sales figures by selling a variety of books belonging to different genres in most of the stalls. Book hop is planning to increase the capacity of existing stalls by introducing new stalls as well. However, before proceeding to new initiations, the management team of Book Hop wants to know the estimation of sales for the forth-coming weeks in all the locations, which would really help in increasing their stall capacities and increasing the number of stalls in the same locations. So they have decided to give historical data and test some Engineers. They will check for better results and if they are satisfied with the results then engineers may get hired for future proceedings.
