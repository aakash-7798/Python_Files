Revenue is all that matters after all Innovations
There isnâ€™t a single day where we are not seeing a new technology emerging. At the same time, a lot of brilliant minds and companies are putting technology and ideas together and bringing them to the market in the form of software or applications. A wide range of people uses this software or applications to make parts of their life easier. Of course, the companies/humans behind these applications are benefitting a lot by generating huge revenue through sales across the world.

Goal: You are a Machine Learning Engineer in XYZ company. The sales of different software/applications developed by top companies and start-ups across the world are given to you. Your goal is to build an ML model to predict global sales by making use of multiple attributes.
